; This file is an annotated disassembly of [TODO: create .trg version when this is done].
; It interprets Qdeql code.

;;;;; SYNTAX NOTES ;;;;;
; Any text after an unquoted semicolon is a comment.
; Instructions are indented and in all-caps.
; Decimal literals are prefixed with "#"; hex literals are prefixed with "0x";
; and ASCII character literals are wrapped in single quotes.
; Any snake_case text identifies a label. Labels identifying a section of code are unindented and followed by a colon,
; while labels used as arguments to instructions do not have the colon.
; Multiple labels may identify the same instruction.

; When comments mention stack layout, it will be in a box diagram like this:
; +===+---+---+
; | a | b | c |
; +===+---+---+
; The left side of the diagram is the bottom of the stack, and the right side is the top of the stack.
; The === indicate that 'a' is an "array" of potentially multiple values filling multiple stack slots,
; while the --- indicate that 'b' and 'c' are each only a single number.
