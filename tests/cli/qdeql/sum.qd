- put a 255 in the queue
& get first input
= make the input earlier than the 255

Here's a neat loop to subtract two values
\ loop until input is zero:
  -- decrement both values
  \/\/ remove the 0s added by the loop
  = put the input back at the front of the queue
/ end loop

& get second input
= swap them around
\--\/\/=/ Same as above

queue has one value: 255 minus i1 minus i2
255 minus that is the sum of the inputs
\=/- enqueue 255
\--\/\/=/ you get the drill
* print the result
